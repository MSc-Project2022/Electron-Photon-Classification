# Electron-Photon-Classification
 We utilized the convolutional neural networks for the electron photon classification. Convolutional neural  networks are a kind of feed-forward neural network that deals with images with high accuracy and less complexity  than a normal Neural network. CNNs use the correlation between neighboring pixels as a way to reduce the  complexity of dealing with large N Ã— N image vectors. We used the Electron-Photon dataset available on  the CERN website for the modeling. In this dataset, electrons are signal images and photons are background  images. The dataset had 32,000 images of electron and photon where every image has dimensions 32 x 32,  with two channels, representing Time and Energy.
